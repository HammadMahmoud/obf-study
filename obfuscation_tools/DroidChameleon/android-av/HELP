Usage: droidc COMMAND... INPUTAPK OUTPUTAPK [PACKAGE]

COMMANDs:
	-renameclasses 			
		The compiled Dalvik bytecode in classes.dex of the application package may be disassembled and then reassembled back again. Signatures that match the whole classes.dex are beaten by this transformation.
	-reverseorder 			
		Through disassembling and assembling the compiled Dalvik bycode, Signatures that depend on the order of different items in the dex file will also likely break with this transformation. 
	-encString 				
		Strings are ecrypted. The dex files contain all the strings and array data. These strings and arrays may be used to develop signatures against malware.
	-encArrays 				
		Arrays are ecrypted. The dex files contain all the strings and array data. These strings and arrays may be used to develop signatures against malware.
	-remDebugInfo 			
		Bytecode typically contains a lot of debug information, such as source file names, local and parameter variable names, and source line numbers. All this information may be stripped off.
	-reorder 				
		Reordering the instructions and inserting goto instructions to preserve the runtime execution sequence of the instructions.
	-nontrivialjunk 			
		Introduce code sequences that are executed but do not affect rest of the program
	-insertnops 				
		Simply inserts sequences of nop instructions in the code. It is easy to detect and undo.
	-insertFunctionIndirection 	
		Given a method call, the call is converted to a call to a previously non-existing method that then calls the method in the original call.
	-doci
		Modifies source code and introduces call indirection
	-renameMethods
		Renames methods contained in the source code
	-renameFields
		Renames fields contained in the source code

PACKAGE:
	Only classes inside the Java package PACKAGE will be modified. The default is the root package. This has no effect fore renameMethods and renameFields transformations.

EXAMPLE: droidc -transType input.apk output.apk com.abc
