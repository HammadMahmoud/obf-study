AndroidManifest
	Repacking
	Detection signatures that match the developer keys or a checksum of the entire application package are rendered ineffective by this transformation.
	Disassembling and Reassembling:
	a compiled program may be represented in more than one form. Signatures that match the whole classes.dex are beaten by this transformation.


Types of Transformations
	1. -transformAndroidManifest 	--> 	transformAndroidManifest('AndroidManifest.xml')
	2. -renameclasses 				--> 	renameclasses('com')
	3. -reverseorder 				--> 	reverseorderRecursive('smali')
    4. -encString 					--> 	encStringsRecursive('com')
    5. -encArrays 					--> 	encArraysRecursive('com')
    6. -remDebugInfo 				--> 	remDebugInfoRec('com')              //removeDebug info
    7. -reorder 					-->		reorderRecursive('smali')
    8. -nontrivialjunk 				-->		nontrivialjunkrecursive('smali')
   	9. -insertnops 					--> 	insertnopsrecursive('FOBkUD')
   10. -insertFuncIndirection 		--> 	insertFuncIndirectionRecursive('hxbvgH')



1)Changing Package Name: Every application is identified by a package name unique to the application. This name is defined in the packageâ€™s AndroidManifest.


2) Identifier Renaming: pointer...

3) Data Encryption:
All the strings are stored in an encoded form, such as by the application of a simple Caesar cipher

4) Call Indirections:
A call C --> A call B(created by us), B call C

5) Code Reordering    This transformation is accomplished by reordering the instructions and inserting goto instructions to preserve the runtime execution sequence of the instructions.

6) Junk Code Insertion:
introduce code sequences that are executed but do not affect rest of the program


7) Encrypting Payloads and Native Exploits:   Some malware will pack code exploiots and decrypted at runtime. we can encrypted the bytecode for these programs.

8) Function Outlining and Inlining: In function outlining, a function is broken down into several smaller functions. Function inlining involves replacing a function call with the entire function body. 


9)
